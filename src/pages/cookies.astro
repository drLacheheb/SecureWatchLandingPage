                    This Cookie Policy explains how SecureWatch uses cookies and
                    similar technologies to recognize you when you visit our
                    website.

                <h2>1. What are cookies?</h2>
                <p>
                    Cookies are small data files that are placed on your
                    computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies
                    are widely used by website owners in order to make their
                    websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to
                    provide reporting information.
                </p>

                <h2>2. Why do we use cookies?</h2>
                <p>
                    We use first-party and third-party cookies for several
                    reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in
                    order for our Websites to operate, and we refer to these as
                    "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies.
                </p>

                <h2>3. How can I control cookies?</h2>
                <p>
                    You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject
                    cookies. You can exercise your cookie rights by setting your
                    preferences in the Cookie Consent Manager.
                </p>

                <h2>4. Changes to the Cookie Policy</h2>
                <p>
                    We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order
                    to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use or
                    for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons.
